<h3>Whittlebury Park &#8211; Sunday, 29th September, 2019</h3>



<p>The September away day took place under stressful circumstances not helped by a gloomy weather forecast that led to some absentees. The forecast proved to be disappointingly accurate and the predicted rainstorm and high winds arrived as play took place. Winner on the day was Mike Stannard with 29 points who also took nearest the pin on the 5th hole. Martin Sykes struck the longest drive of the day.</p>



<h3>Birthday Bash!!</h3>



<p>Looking ahead into 2020, we&#8217;re looking forward to the annual &#8220;Birthday Bash&#8221; that will take place this year at West Berks Golf Club on Sunday, 16th February with a first tee time of midday (meet at 11am). The cost for golf and prize kitty is a very reasonable £20. Please let Peter know if you&#8217;re able to attend and please note that there is no requirement for up-front payment on this occasion.</p>



<p>We hope to see as many of you there as possible.</p>

<h3>Whittlebury Park &#8211; Sunday, 29th September 2019</h3>



<p>Our final away day of the year will see a return to Whittlebury Park where we have been assured of buggy availability and fine course conditions.</p>



<p>First tee time is 10:00am and the cost is £25 including coffee and bacon roll on arrival. The cost to hire a buggy is £25.</p>



<p>Whittlebury Park have asked for payment in advance, so if you&#8217;re able to join us please transfer funds to the normal Harris Golf trip account asap. Peter will send a text with the account details for those who have misplaced it.</p>



<p>Finally, a small update regarding our May trip next year &#8211; a 9 hole &#8220;Woodland Walk&#8221; has been added to the itinerary for Monday with a tee time of 4:30pm. Perfect for those who would otherwise spend the entire afternoon and evening in the bar &#8211; yes Phil, that&#8217;s you!!</p>
