<h3>A Message from Peter&#8230;</h3>



<p>With some government potential relaxation of golfing / hospitality rules from 17th May &#8211; the day after planned start of our visit to the Dorset I have taken the following steps:</p>



<p>Moved the main event to September, potentially starting Sunday 6th at a venue to be confirmed &#8211; Golf Travel are exploring options here.</p>



<p>The May event will now take place on a slimmed down basis for those interested &#8211; starting Monday 17th May</p>



<p>It will be subject to &#8220;pods&#8221; of max six for accommodation/eating purposes.</p>



<p>It will comprise 2 nights and three rounds of golf at a cost of £252.</p>



<p>Please let me know if you would like to join me/the Wains for this or whether you prefer to wait until things return to some sort of normality.</p>



<p>I look forward to hearing from you with your thoughts.</p>

<h3>2021 Tour Update</h3>



<p>With the new year upon us Peter wished to set out the current position with our trip planned to start on 16th May:</p>



<p>At present we have 21 participants who have paid deposits / paid in full / or somewhere in between for a booking in Lodge accommodation and breakfast &amp; dinner plus 4 rounds of golf on site plus an away day at Bridport on the Tuesday.</p>



<p>Having spoken to the venue &amp; Your Golf Travel I am told that, whilst the resort is closed due to Covid at the moment, they are hopeful that by May things will have returned to some sort of normality.</p>



<p>I do hope that things will work out and we can meet up again.</p>



<p>If you have reservations or wish to be added to the event please let me know.</p>



<p>Stay safe</p>



<p>Peter</p>

<h3>A Message from Peter</h3>



<p>To my very good friends,<br>With the C virus likely to peak at/during/near to our proposed visit, and the certainty that some of our group will not be present for very good reasons, I have bitten the bullet and arranged with Your Golf Travel (our agents) to postpone the trip for 12 months.<br>This will mean that deposits/payments already made will not be lost. Of less importance, it means we also secure more advantageous tee times for next year.</p>



<p>New date for 2021 is Sunday, 16th May. Full running order to follow.<br>In the meantime we have those who have paid a deposit &#8211; who will not be affected &#8211; and others who have paid in full. If this is you, please let me know if you would like a refund/part refund or whether you are happy to leave things as they are for the interim.<br>In the short term I will play things by ear in respect of the planned away-day on 18th April  and hope that something can happen &#8211; probably on a golf-only basis.<br>Also, and depending on how things pan out, I will look for a get together over one weekend in August/September.<br>Stand by for more news.<br>All the best, and please take care.</p>



<p>Peter</p>
