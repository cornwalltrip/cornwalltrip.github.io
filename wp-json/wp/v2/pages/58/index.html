As is often the case at this venue, the scoring was very good and the team competition was particularly close. The competition format was individual Stableford and the team format was 1 score to count for holes 1-6, 2 scores to count for holes 7-12 and all 3 scores to count for the remainder.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style_7\">Individual champion on the day was Dave Mitchell with a very creditable 40 points. We would ask the handicap secretary to take note of this, particularly as Dave is the handicap secretary!<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style_7\">Longest drive on the day was hit by Frank Tanner, Dave Scott won the nearest-the-pin-in-2 and Dave Mitchell won nearest-the-pin.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"id157\" class=\"style_SkipStroke_1 shape-with-text\">\n<div class=\"text-content graphic_textbox_layout_style_default_External_122_82\">\n<div class=\"graphic_textbox_layout_style_default\">\n<div id=\"id146\" class=\"style_SkipStroke_1 shape-with-text\">\n<div class=\"text-content graphic_textbox_layout_style_default_External_361_48\">\n<div class=\"graphic_textbox_layout_style_default\">\n<h3 class=\"paragraph_style_11\">Sunday April 14th, 2014 &#8211; West Berks Golf Club<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"id147\" class=\"style_SkipStroke_1 shape-with-text\">\n<div class=\"text-content graphic_textbox_layout_style_default_External_122_82\">\n<div class=\"graphic_textbox_layout_style_default\">\n<h5>Individual Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Christine Mitchell \u00a0&#8211; 35 pts<\/li>\n<li>Ron Brown &#8211; 33 pts<\/li>\n<li>Geoff Scott &#8211; 33 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A lovely spring day was enjoyed by our group who found the course in great condition. The team game was the dreaded \u201cYellow Ball\u201d which always adds a little tension to whoever has to try and retain possession of it. Some tough negotiation was witnessed at the 1st tee as team members tried to work out who would have to hit the Yellow Ball across the lake on the 18th. Most teams shouldn\u2019t have worried, as the ball was lost well before that hole!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"id153\" class=\"style_SkipStroke_1 shape-with-text\">\n<div class=\"text-content graphic_textbox_layout_style_default_External_698_148\">\n<div class=\"graphic_textbox_layout_style_default\">\n<p class=\"paragraph_style\"><span class=\"style_1\">The Spring Runaway day always provides an early glimpse of form for the upcoming tour, so it was interesting to see Christine win the day with a very solid 35 points. Geoff could also be worth a flutter if he maintains the form that saw him score 33 points. Christine also won Nearest the Pin and Dave S secured Nearest the Pin in 2. Mike Stannard claimed the Longest drive on the 16th hole with a 3-wood.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"paragraph_style\"><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sunday February 15th, 2015 &#8211; Carswell Golf Club Individual Event Dave Scott &#8211; 39 pts Team Event Dave S, Christine &amp; Martin A cold, grey, but thankfully dry day saw the usual suspects gather for the first meeting of 2015.
