I assume that Peter took note and personally I can\u2019t wait to see what added attractions he has planned for us at the next away day. Perhaps a Vintage Steam Rally?<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"paragraph_style\">Sunday March 28th, 2010 &#8211; West Berks Golf Club<\/h3>\n<h5>Individual Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Frank Tanner &#8211; 33 pts<\/li>\n<li>Richard Edmonds &#8211; 30 pts<\/li>\n<li>Nigel Wain &#8211; 28 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5>Team Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Peter H, Frank, Reg &amp; Bob Westwood &#8211; 74 pts<\/li>\n<li>Richard E, Geoff, Steve M &amp; Martin<em> aka &#8220;Dream Team&#8221;<\/em> &#8211; 72 pts<\/li>\n<li>Dave S, Steve C &amp; Nigel &#8211; 63 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Nearest the pin was won by Richard Edmonds.

The course was over-booked resulting in a delayed start and the abandonment of the round after 14 holes due to fading light and stultifying boredom. We will not be returning anytime soon, and the Spring away day will be staged at a venue that can host the event within daylight hours.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style\">In the team event, the only team who managed to retain their Yellow Ball triumphed.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"paragraph_style\">Sunday September 7th, 2008 &#8211; West Berks Golf Club<\/h3>\n<h5>Individual Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Pete Cosford &#8211; 34 pts<\/li>\n<li>Dave Scott &#8211; 32 pts<\/li>\n<li>Martin Sykes &#8211; 31 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5>Team Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Richard E, Geoff &amp; Martin &#8211; 77 pts<\/li>\n<li>Pete C, Peter H &amp; Sue S &#8211; 71 pts<\/li>\n<li>Dave S, Steve M &amp; Reg &#8211; 63 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Pete Cosford took both the Longest Drive and Nearest the Pin in 2 prizes, with Peter &#8220;dead aim&#8221; Harris winning the Nearest the Pin prize.<\/p>\n<h3>Sunday April 13th, 2008 &#8211; Rye Hill Golf Club<\/h3>\n<h5>Individual Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Steve Mulford &#8211; 30 pts<\/li>\n<li>Dave Scott &#8211; 28 pts<\/li>\n<li>Peter Harris &#8211; 26 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5>Team Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Steve M, Dave S &amp; Reg &#8211; 62 pts<\/li>\n<li>Peter H, Phil &amp; Martin &#8211; 61 pts<\/li>\n<li>Pete C, Geoff &amp; Sue 52 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Honourable mention to Phil Reay who was only pipped for the Bronze medal in the individual competition on count back.<\/p>\n<p>Dave Scott took both the Longest Drive and Nearest the Pin prizes, but there was no winner of the Nearest the Pin in 2 prize.<\/p>\n<h3>Sunday September 9th, 2007 &#8211; Rye Hill Golf Club<\/h3>\n<h5>Individual Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Peter Harris &#8211; 35 pts<\/li>\n<li>Steve Christie &#8211; 33 pts<\/li>\n<li>Dave Scott &#8211; 31 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5>Team Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Steve M, Pete C, Steve C &amp; Sue S &#8211; 83 pts<\/li>\n<li>Richard E, Peter H, Martin &amp; Phil &#8211; 81 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Peter Harris took the Longest Drive and Dave Scott took both the Nearest the Pin and Nearest the Pin in 2 prizes.<\/p>\n<div id=\"id11\" class=\"style_SkipStroke_1 shape-with-text\">\n<div class=\"text-content graphic_textbox_layout_style_default_External_391_48\">\n<div class=\"graphic_textbox_layout_style_default\">\n<h3 class=\"paragraph_style_3\">Sunday March 25th, 2007 &#8211; Donnington Valley Golf Club<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"id12\" class=\"style_SkipStroke_1 shape-with-text\">\n<div class=\"text-content graphic_textbox_layout_style_default_External_700_87\">\n<div class=\"graphic_textbox_layout_style_default\">\n<p class=\"paragraph_style\">Our spring runaway day was another success with Tour veterans graciously stepping aside for the newcomers to clear up the prizes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style\">Winner was Chris Rushton (19 handicap) with 32 points.

The day was a great success with the Christie team victorious despite a last minute withdrawal by the team captain.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style\">The scoring format was that for each team, the best two Stapleford scores on each hole would contribute. The Christie team of Geoff Scott, Martin Sykes and Richard Edmonds scored a commendable total of 73 points to beat the Craston team of Peter Harris, Peter Cosford and Rick Budd. The Craston team graciously chose not to include the scores of their late-arriving but warmly welcomed Team Captain (although it would not have changed the result).<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style\">The overall view was that the day was a great success and so we are hoping to instigate bi-annual (that&#8217;s twice a year) runaway days in the Spring (as a preparation for the challenge of our trip to Cornwall) and in the autumn (for those fair-weather golfers wishing to say goodbye to the season for another year).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Saturday 25th September, 2010 &#8211; Banbury Golf Club Individual Event Frank Tanner &#8211; 42 pts John Pritchard &#8211; 35 pts Dave Scott &#8211; 35 pts Team Event Peter H, Frank, Nick Powell &amp; Ted F &#8211; 84 pts Richard E, Sue S, Martin &amp; JP &#8211; 70 pts Dave S, Phil, Geoff &amp; Reg &#8211; [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"page-templates\/full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/402"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=402"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/402\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=402"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
