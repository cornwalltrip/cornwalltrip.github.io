Honourable mention should also be made of John Gent who score 36 points but missed out on third place following a count-back. The team game was everybody\u2019s favourite &#8211; Yellow Ball &#8211; and many dreams of victory were dashed on the par three 8th which is surrounded by water!<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style\">Nearest the Pin was won by Peter Harris. Nearest the Pin in 2 was won by Richard Kidner and the Longest Drive was won by Richard Edmonds. The all important 2\u2019s sweep saw money being passed to Nigel W, John G and our host Mr Harris (twice).<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"paragraph_style\">Saturday 18th September, 2011 &#8211; Banbury Golf Club<\/h3>\n<h5>Individual Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Dave Mitchell &#8211; 43 pts<\/li>\n<li>Frank Tanner &#8211; 43 pts<\/li>\n<li>Nigel Wain &#8211; 40 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5>Team Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Frank, Dave M &amp; Richard K &#8211; 122 pts<\/li>\n<li>Pete C, Marin &amp; Phil &#8211; 108 pts<\/li>\n<li>Steve C, JP &amp; Sue P &#8211; 105 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>43 points from the Handicap Secretary was just enough to sneak the win away from Frank on count back. \u00a0 Everyone is looking forward to hearing the revised handicaps at our next outing. \u00a0Pictures from the day have been added to the Photo Gallery.<\/p>\n<h3>Sunday July 24th, 2011 &#8211; South Cerney Golf Club<\/h3>\n<h5>Individual Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Martin Sykes &#8211; 41 pts<\/li>\n<li>Christine Mitchell &#8211; 37 pts<\/li>\n<li>Nigel Wain &#8211; 37 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5>Team Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Nigel, Dave Numan &amp; Martin &#8211; 81 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style\">Nearest the Pin was won by Christine Mitchell (she succeeded where all else failed &#8211; to hit the green).

Special mention must also be made of Frank Tanner for achieving a \u2018hole-in-1\u2019 at the 10th.
