Frank won the day with a very solid 35 points with Pete Cosford, Nigel and Phil all scoring 34 points. Pete also secured Nearest the Pin in 2 and Phil secured Nearest the Pin. Nigel claimed the Longest drive on the 18th hole. A magnificent drive that was in no way aided by the fact that the marker was withdrawn from play before the final group reached the tee. To be fair, considering that Richard needed to be convinced by the course Professional that they hadn\u2019t re-modelled the 1st hole again, it\u2019s no surprise that such errors were made during the course of play &#8211; jet lag is a terrible thing.<\/p>\n<h3>July 27th, 2013 &#8211; South Cerney Golf Club<\/h3>\n<p>A good attendance once again and very fine weather greeted us at South Cerney. Some excellent scores were made on the day including a fine 39 points by Geoff Scott. However, no one could match the superb 43 points scored by Christine Mitchell &#8211; a worthy winner.<\/p>\n<h3>Sunday April 7th, 2013 &#8211; West Berks Golf Club<\/h3>\n<h5>Individual Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>John Jent &#8211; 38 pts<\/li>\n<li>Frank Tanner &#8211; 36 pts<\/li>\n<li>Phil Reay &#8211; 35 pts<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5>Team Event<\/h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Christine, Geoff, Richard &amp; Gordon<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style_7\">Twenty golfers attended our first meeting of the year and the weather was much better than the monsoon conditions that we experienced last September at Banbury.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style_7\">In the \u201cYellow Ball\u2019 team game, the team of Christine, Geoff, Richard and Gordon triumphed although the result could have been different if the organiser has remembered that actually returning a yellow ball at the end of the round gains you additional points!<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph_style_7\">Individually, John Gent won with a very good score of 38 points despite being cut 4 shots after his victory at Whittlebury Park last year. The handicap secretary was seen to take note of John\u2019s continuing good form.
