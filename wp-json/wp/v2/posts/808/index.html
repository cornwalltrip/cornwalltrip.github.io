Once again, the genius of relocating from Cornwall to that notorious sunny land that is Wales had clearly paid dividends. Unfortunately, once our matches were underway we soon discovered why the countryside appeared quite so lush and green. The rain fell with uncommon vigour, blew sideways beneath umbrellas, and generally made a nuisance of itself. It did eventually clear, and for the rest of the week the normal  Welsh conditions of bright sunshine returned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the golf on the first day, the results were as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob and Emily Austen beat Dave and Sue Scott<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard and Steve M lost to Dave Mitchell on the last hole<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>John P and Reg lost to Jane and Martin &#8211; again on the last hole<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Derek and Christine lost to David W and a resurgent Bruce<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sue P and Paul N beat Peter and Nigel, once again on the last hole<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sport prizes went to Peter for NTP on the 3rd, Martin for NTP on the 11th, Bruce for NTP in 2 at the 9th and David W and Sue P for longest drive on the 17th.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, Derek&#8217;s team lagged behind the others by a single point,  2 to 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>St Pierre &#8211; Old Course &#8211; Monday, 20th May (am)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An early start with bright sunshine saw the Open Championship contested on a very well presented and maintained course. The winner this year was long time &#8220;nearly man&#8221; Dave Scott with 38 points. Runner up was Rob with 34 points followed closely by Dave M with 33 points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spot prizes went to Peter for NTP on the 3rd, Dave S for NTP on the 6th, Christine for NTP in 2 on the 18th and Rob and Christine for longest drive on the 14th. Both Dave S and Richard made birdie 2s on the 6th hole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>St Pierre &#8211; Mathern Course &#8211; Monday, 20th May (pm)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Monday afternoon saw mixed formats played &#8211; 2 Greensomes, a scramble and a 9 hole challenge. Whilst no scores were added to the team event, the spot prizes went to David W for NTP on the 11th, David and Jane for NTP in 2 at the 9th and longest drive for Martin and Sue P on the 17th. David W also secured a birdie 2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>St Mellons Golf Club &#8211; Tuesday, 21st May<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The team competition resumed on another glorious sunny day with the 4 ball, better ball format. Match one saw our newly crowned champion Dave S overcome the challenge of Dave M and Sue P. However, that was the only blip in an otherwise perfect day for Derek&#8217;s team. Paul N and Reg beat David W and Martin, JP and Christine overcame Phil and Jane, Derek and Fay beat Nigel and Sue S and finally Richard and Steve M defeated Peter and Bruce with the final putt of their match. This meant that Derek&#8217;s team now had a 2 point lead heading into the final day&#8217;s singles event: 6-4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spot prizes went to Phil for a very impressive NTP on the 5th (BTW, he missed the putt&#8230;), Christine for NTP on the 11th, JP for NTP in 2 on the 15th and Richard and Fay with longest drive on the 18th.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>St Pierre &#8211; Old Course &#8211; Wednesday, 22nd May<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any thoughts of Derek&#8217;s team loosening their grip on the trophy were soon dispelled as the results came in for the final day&#8217;s singles. JP beat Dave M, Sue P beat Sue S, Steve M defeated Martin to claim the golden trophy, Christine saw off Nigel, Paul N beat Peter and Derek defeated Jane. The only players not to succumb to the might of Derek&#8217;s team were David W who  managed to squeak ahead of Fay with a superb chip on the 18th, and Dave S who continued his fine form on the Old Course against Richard who didn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant the final score for the team competition was 12 &#8211; 6 in favour of Derek&#8217;s team. Spot prizes went to Christine for NTP on the 6th, David W for NTP in 2 on the 18th, Dave S for NTP in 3 on the 16th and Dave for longest drive on the 9th. Both JP and Dave S recorded birdie 2s.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>St Pierre &#8211; Mathern Course &#8211; Sunday, 19th May The day begun full of summer promise with bright sunshine and warm conditions.
