Worthy winners as they were the only team to\u00a0return the Yellow ball safely.<\/p>\n<p>Individual winner on the day was Sue with 37 points.

This feat was made more remarkable by the flypast of Spitfires and Hurricanes that accompanied it.<\/p>\n<p>We all look forward to the next away day at Chipping Norton.
