The forecast proved to be disappointingly accurate and the predicted rainstorm and high winds arrived as play took place. Winner on the day was Mike Stannard with 29 points who also took nearest the pin on the 5th hole. Martin Sykes struck the longest drive of the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Birthday Bash!!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead into 2020, we&#8217;re looking forward to the annual &#8220;Birthday Bash&#8221; that will take place this year at West Berks Golf Club on Sunday, 16th February with a first tee time of midday (meet at 11am). The cost for golf and prize kitty is a very reasonable \u00a320.
