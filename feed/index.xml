<h3>A Message from Peter&#8230;</h3>



<p>With some government potential relaxation of golfing / hospitality rules from 17th May &#8211; the day after planned start of our visit to the Dorset I have taken the following steps:</p>



<p>Moved the main event to September, potentially starting Sunday 6th at a venue to be confirmed &#8211; Golf Travel are exploring options here.</p>



<p>The May event will now take place on a slimmed down basis for those interested &#8211; starting Monday 17th May</p>



<p>It will be subject to &#8220;pods&#8221; of max six for accommodation/eating purposes.</p>



<p>It will comprise 2 nights and three rounds of golf at a cost of £252.</p>



<p>Please let me know if you would like to join me/the Wains for this or whether you prefer to wait until things return to some sort of normality.</p>



<p>I look forward to hearing from you with your thoughts.</p>

<h3>2021 Tour Update</h3>



<p>With the new year upon us Peter wished to set out the current position with our trip planned to start on 16th May:</p>



<p>At present we have 21 participants who have paid deposits / paid in full / or somewhere in between for a booking in Lodge accommodation and breakfast &amp; dinner plus 4 rounds of golf on site plus an away day at Bridport on the Tuesday.</p>



<p>Having spoken to the venue &amp; Your Golf Travel I am told that, whilst the resort is closed due to Covid at the moment, they are hopeful that by May things will have returned to some sort of normality.</p>



<p>I do hope that things will work out and we can meet up again.</p>



<p>If you have reservations or wish to be added to the event please let me know.</p>



<p>Stay safe</p>



<p>Peter</p>

<h3>A Message from Peter</h3>



<p>To my very good friends,<br>With the C virus likely to peak at/during/near to our proposed visit, and the certainty that some of our group will not be present for very good reasons, I have bitten the bullet and arranged with Your Golf Travel (our agents) to postpone the trip for 12 months.<br>This will mean that deposits/payments already made will not be lost. Of less importance, it means we also secure more advantageous tee times for next year.</p>



<p>New date for 2021 is Sunday, 16th May. Full running order to follow.<br>In the meantime we have those who have paid a deposit &#8211; who will not be affected &#8211; and others who have paid in full. If this is you, please let me know if you would like a refund/part refund or whether you are happy to leave things as they are for the interim.<br>In the short term I will play things by ear in respect of the planned away-day on 18th April  and hope that something can happen &#8211; probably on a golf-only basis.<br>Also, and depending on how things pan out, I will look for a get together over one weekend in August/September.<br>Stand by for more news.<br>All the best, and please take care.</p>



<p>Peter</p>

<h3>Whittlebury Park &#8211; Sunday, 29th September, 2019</h3>



<p>The September away day took place under stressful circumstances not helped by a gloomy weather forecast that led to some absentees. The forecast proved to be disappointingly accurate and the predicted rainstorm and high winds arrived as play took place. Winner on the day was Mike Stannard with 29 points who also took nearest the pin on the 5th hole. Martin Sykes struck the longest drive of the day.</p>



<h3>Birthday Bash!!</h3>



<p>Looking ahead into 2020, we&#8217;re looking forward to the annual &#8220;Birthday Bash&#8221; that will take place this year at West Berks Golf Club on Sunday, 16th February with a first tee time of midday (meet at 11am). The cost for golf and prize kitty is a very reasonable £20. Please let Peter know if you&#8217;re able to attend and please note that there is no requirement for up-front payment on this occasion.</p>



<p>We hope to see as many of you there as possible.</p>

<h3>Whittlebury Park &#8211; Sunday, 29th September 2019</h3>



<p>Our final away day of the year will see a return to Whittlebury Park where we have been assured of buggy availability and fine course conditions.</p>



<p>First tee time is 10:00am and the cost is £25 including coffee and bacon roll on arrival. The cost to hire a buggy is £25.</p>



<p>Whittlebury Park have asked for payment in advance, so if you&#8217;re able to join us please transfer funds to the normal Harris Golf trip account asap. Peter will send a text with the account details for those who have misplaced it.</p>



<p>Finally, a small update regarding our May trip next year &#8211; a 9 hole &#8220;Woodland Walk&#8221; has been added to the itinerary for Monday with a tee time of 4:30pm. Perfect for those who would otherwise spend the entire afternoon and evening in the bar &#8211; yes Phil, that&#8217;s you!!</p>
